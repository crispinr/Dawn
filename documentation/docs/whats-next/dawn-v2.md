# What's Next?

We are planning to launch **Dawn V2** soon after getting the feedback from users.

Here are some features that remain in top priority for us:

### Favourites

Admins can set a token Id (Image NFTs or music) as favourites and use them to display NFTs or play music in the channels

### Music Playlists

Admins or people with assigned roles can create playlists which will be encrypted and stored in a decentralized storage and can be fetched to play in voice channels.

### Schedulers

Admins can set schedulers to the auctions and Asks they create to advertise this listings to his community.

### Mint, Ask, Auction

Anyone can mint list or auction NFTs by a quick browser redirect which automatically stores data in our encrypted storage.
