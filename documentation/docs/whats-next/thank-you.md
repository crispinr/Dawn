# The End :)

Our project is **open-sourced** and **contributions** are appreciated.

## How we made it

We used **Zora Dev Kit ( ZDK )** for fetching

- aggregateAttributes
- collection
- collections
- collectionStatsAggregate
- events
- floorPrice
- markets
- mints
- nftCount
- ownerCount
- ownersByCount
- sales
- salesVolume
- search
- token
- tokens

  We displayed them using appropriate relevant slash commands. We used **discordjs** to build our bot. We used **docusaurus** to document our product mimicing the Zora docs theme. We faced a lot of challenges and brainstormed a lot to bring this product into production. Our product supports **Ethereum Mainnet**.

## Gratitude to Sponsors

We would like to thank [**Zora**](https://zora.co/) and [**ETHGlobal**](https://ethglobal.com/) for helping us build this project over the weekend from **Aug 4 to Aug 8** for **Metabolism 2022**. We hope you liked our project. Please share your comments by joining our discord server and ping us in case you need any help. Have a good one XD.
